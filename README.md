# What is this project?

__Melody Generation__ is a personal side project aiming to generate music using LSTM models.
It is strongly inspired by:
* Valerio Velardo's work, found here: https://github.com/musikalkemist/generating-melodies-with-rnn-lstm

# Why?
* I'm an amateur guitar player so teaching a computer to generate music blew my mind

# Characteristics

Current characteristics:
*  Uses MIDI file as an input
*  It is a single-instrument problem
*  Dataset comes from the 

Code style.
I'm not the best programmer, but I follow this rules:
* Simple and understandable over complex
* Self explanatory variables names
* Description of every function and class
