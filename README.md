# What is this project?

__Melody Generation__ is a personal side project aiming to generate music using LSTM models.
It is strongly inspired by:
* Valerio Velardo's work, found here: https://github.com/musikalkemist/generating-melodies-with-rnn-lstm

# Why?

# Characteristics

Current characteristics:
*  Consideration of notes and chords for a single part of a MIDI file
*  It is not multi-instrumental
*  Model is LSTM -> Dropout -> Softmax

Samples of generated melodies can be seen on my youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwZq-2Z7ILP9Gqg4ms4V5g430v7z9o5xF

Code style.
I'm not the best programmer, but I follow this rules:
* Simple and understandable over complex
* Self explanatory variables names
* Description of every function and class
