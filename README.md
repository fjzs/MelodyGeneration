Melody Generation is a project aiming to generate music from public datasets using LSTM neural networks models.
It is strongly inspired by Valerio Velardo's work, found here: https://github.com/musikalkemist/generating-melodies-with-rnn-lstm

Current characteristics:
*  Consideration of notes and chords for a single part of a MIDI file
*  Model is LSTM -> Dropout -> Softmax

Samples of generated melodies can be seen on my youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwZq-2Z7ILP9Gqg4ms4V5g430v7z9o5xF
